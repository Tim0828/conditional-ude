####### ANALYSIS: WHY MODELS PERFORM BETTER ON TEST THAN TRAINING DATA #######

# Based on the analysis of the code and results, I've identified several critical issues
# that explain why the models perform better on test data than training data.

# Issue 1: The R² values show the problem clearly
println("\n1. EVIDENCE FROM R² VALUES:")
println("   Training R² values are extremely negative (worse than random):")
println("   - Partial pooling: -1.72 to -2.27")
println("   - No pooling: -0.99 to -1.72")
println("   - MLE: 0.87 to 0.91 (reasonable)")
println("\n   Test R² values are much better:")
println("   - Partial pooling: -0.42 to 0.52")
println("   - No pooling: -0.16 to -0.13")
println("   - MLE: 0.84 to 0.87")

println("\n2. ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED:")

println("\n   A. FUNDAMENTAL TRAINING FLAW:")
println("      The training process has a critical flaw in how it calculates training performance.")
println("      Looking at the code:")
println("      ")
println("      In train_ADVI_models_partial_pooling():")
println("      - Trains nn_params + betas on indices_train (70% of training data)")
println("      - Validates on indices_validation (30% of training data)")
println("      - Selects best nn_params based on validation MSE")
println("      - BUT: When calculating training R², it uses betas_train with the selected nn_params")
println("      - PROBLEM: betas_train were optimized for the OLD nn_params, not the selected ones!")

println("\n   B. PARAMETER MISMATCH:")
println("      - Neural network parameters (nn_params) are updated during training")
println("      - But the stored training betas (betas_train) correspond to the INITIAL nn_params")
println("      - When evaluating training performance, we use NEW nn_params with OLD betas")
println("      - This creates a severe mismatch leading to terrible training performance")

println("\n   C. TEST DATA ADVANTAGE:")
println("      - Test betas are trained specifically for the final selected nn_params")
println("      - This creates a fair pairing: selected nn_params + optimized test betas")
println("      - Result: Test performance appears much better than training")

println("\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS:")
println("      From VI_models.jl lines 250-290:")
println("      - nn_params, betas_train, advi_model = train_ADVI(turing_model_train, ...)")
println("      - This trains BOTH nn_params AND betas together")
println("      - But only nn_params is carried forward to test")
println("      - betas_train becomes obsolete when nn_params changes")

println("\n4. VERIFICATION:")
println("      MLE method doesn't have this issue because:")
println("      - It doesn't use neural networks")
println("      - No parameter mismatch possible")
println("      - Shows normal train > test pattern (0.90 vs 0.85 R²)")

println("\n5. SOLUTIONS:")
println("      A. IMMEDIATE FIX:")
println("         - Retrain training betas using the final selected nn_params")
println("         - This will give fair comparison between train and test")
println("      ")
println("      B. BETTER APPROACH:")
println("         - Use proper cross-validation")
println("         - Keep nn_params fixed during beta optimization")
println("         - Or use nested cross-validation for hyperparameter selection")
println("      ")
println("      C. CORRECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION:")
println("         - After selecting final nn_params, retrain ALL betas (train + test)")
println("         - This ensures fair comparison")
