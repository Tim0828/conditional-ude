# Analysis: Why Models Perform Better on Test Set Than Training Set

## Problem Summary

The variational inference models (partial pooling and no pooling) in your c-peptide analysis show suspicious performance patterns:

- **Training R² values**: -1.72 to -2.27 (extremely negative)
- **Test R² values**: -0.42 to 0.52 (much better)
- **MLE R² values**: Train 0.90, Test 0.85 (normal pattern)

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Core Issue: Parameter Mismatch

The training process has a fundamental flaw in the `train_ADVI_models_partial_pooling()` and `train_ADVI_models_no_pooling()` functions:

1. **Training Phase**: Multiple neural network parameter sets (`nn_params`) are trained simultaneously with their corresponding beta parameters
2. **Selection Phase**: The best `nn_params` is selected based on validation performance
3. **Evaluation Phase**: Training performance is evaluated using the **selected** `nn_params` with the **original** beta parameters

This creates a severe mismatch because:

- The stored `betas_train` were optimized for the **initial** `nn_params`
- But evaluation uses the **final selected** `nn_params`
- Result: Incompatible parameter combinations leading to terrible performance

### Why Test Performance Appears Better

- Test betas (`betas_test`) are trained specifically for the **final selected** `nn_params`
- This creates a proper pairing: `final_nn_params` + `compatible_test_betas`
- Result: Test performance appears much better than training

### Evidence Supporting This Diagnosis

1. **Negative R² values**: Training R² < 0 means the model performs worse than predicting the mean
2. **MLE unaffected**: MLE doesn't use neural networks, so shows normal train > test pattern
3. **Magnitude of difference**: The extreme difference (-2.27 vs 0.52) suggests a bug, not generalization

## The Fix

### Implemented Solution

I've modified the training functions in `VI_models.jl` to add this code after model selection:

```julia
# FIX: Retrain training betas with final nn_params for fair evaluation
println("Retraining training betas with final nn_params for fair evaluation...")
priors_train_final = estimate_priors(train_data, models_train, nn_params, indices_train)
turing_model_train_final = partial_pooled_test(
    train_data.cpeptide[indices_train, :],
    train_data.timepoints,
    models_train[indices_train],
    nn_params,  # Use the FINAL selected nn_params
    priors_train_final
)
# Retrain betas that are compatible with the selected nn_params
betas_corrected, _ = train_ADVI(turing_model_train_final, advi_iterations, 10_000, 3, true)
# Replace the old betas with corrected ones
betas = betas_corrected
```

### What This Fix Does

- After selecting the best `nn_params`, retrain the training betas specifically for these parameters
- Ensures fair comparison: `final_nn_params` + `compatible_train_betas` vs `final_nn_params` + `compatible_test_betas`
- Should eliminate the extreme negative R² values

## Expected Results After Fix

1. **Training R² values**: Should be positive and reasonable (> -0.5)
2. **Train vs Test pattern**: Should show normal pattern where training ≥ test performance
3. **Individual subjects**: No more extremely negative R² values

## Files Modified

- `src/VI_models.jl`: Added the fix to both `train_ADVI_models_partial_pooling()` and `train_ADVI_models_no_pooling()`
- Created test scripts to verify the fix works

## Next Steps

1. **Run the fix**: Execute the updated training code
2. **Verify results**: Check that training R² values are now reasonable
3. **Re-evaluate conclusions**: Any analysis based on the train/test comparison should be re-done

## Broader Implications

This bug affects:

- Model comparison conclusions
- Generalization performance claims
- Any analysis suggesting the models generalize unusually well

The models are likely not performing better on test data - this was an evaluation artifact due to parameter mismatch.
